# Semantic Release

`atomi_release.yaml` is the single source of truth for commit types, release
levels, generated commit-convention documentation, and the semantic-release
plugin chain. Do not add a standalone `.gitlint` file.

## Build-order boundary

The workspace baseline registers the future commands now, but the `releaser`
binary is published by `tools/releaser` at C2 step 2p. Until that fold lands:

- the repository-owned validators check the configuration schema, plugin chain,
  and exact D3 type vocabulary;
- the commit-msg hook remains registered as
  `releaser lint-commit -c atomi_release.yaml`;
- release execution is not considered locally available; and
- `sg` remains only as a temporary Nix-shell bootstrap dependency.

After step 2p, `releaser` replaces that bootstrap dependency and the registered
commit and release commands become executable.

## Commands

```bash
releaser lint-commit -c atomi_release.yaml <commit-message-file>
releaser conventions
releaser release -c atomi_release.yaml
```

`releaser conventions` maintains
`docs/developer/CommitConventions.md`. The generated file must not be edited by
hand.

## Configuration

The base plugin order is fixed:

1. `@semantic-release/changelog`
2. `@semantic-release/exec`
3. `@semantic-release/git`
4. `@semantic-release/github`

Plugin versions are pinned in `atomi_release.yaml`. The exec plugin updates
`VERSION`; the git plugin commits `Changelog.md`, `VERSION`, and the generated
commit-conventions document.

Go libraries are the sanctioned no-manifest variance: semantic release keeps
the changelog, git, and GitHub plugins but has no exec stamp and no `VERSION`
asset. The committed `vX.Y.Z` tag is the module version served by the Go proxy.

The unified D3 commit-type vocabulary is:

```text
amend, build, chore, ci, config, dep, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, style, test
```

Both commit validation and release calculation consume this same configuration,
so the vocabularies cannot drift independently.

## Workflow

1. `CI` completes successfully on `main`.
2. `release.yaml` starts through `workflow_run` with concurrency group
   `release`.
3. `scripts/ci/release.sh` runs inside `nix develop .#releaser`.
4. `releaser release -c atomi_release.yaml` calculates the version, updates the
   changelog and generated files, creates the tag, and publishes the GitHub
   release.

Actual release execution remains gated on the C2 step-2p `tools/releaser` fold.
